The MUST-B data contains foraging polygons, and polygons are classified by their resource provision (classes 1-3, low-high). 

As a starter, we want to produce 3 flower patches, one for each resource provision class.

Since we have also the center coordinate for each foraging polygon, we probably can also calculate the distance to the hives (site/hive locations SHOULD be in center of the foraging patches, or?). 

From the data description: 
For shrub and tree:
3 = large and abundant
2 = of intermediate size or small
but abundant
1 = small and not abundant
For herb and sub-shrub:
3 = covers at least 75% of the
area and flowers are abundant
2 = covers 25-75% of the area
and flowers are abundant
1 = covers less than 25% and/or
flowers are not abundant
