Here we give an overview where and how we gathered the data. 

## MUST-B EFSA data source

Data downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/4953762#.YYQmzJso_s2, we used v2 because it included GPS positions of sites. 

## Foraging hours from JRC

We downloaded site-specific irradiation and temperature data from https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/#TMY

Notes: I used global_irradiation, probably from year 2013. TODO: is there radiation data available also for 2019 and 2020? Maybe somewhere else?
