# Explore a typical meteorological year
Using data from Hinnerup, (DK), we explore how many foraging hours were available in this typical meteorological year (tmy). 
We set a threshold for the minimum temperature and for the minimum global irradiance (W/mÂ²), and sum up all hours per day with values reaching or exceeding these thresholds.  

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library('ggthemes')

# manually removed the last part with the legend from the .csv!

tmy <- read.csv("../data/raw-data/tmy_Hinnerup_56.273_9.987_2007_2016.csv", skip = 16, header = T)
tmy$datetime <- seq.POSIXt(as.POSIXct("2013-01-01 01:00"), by = "60 min", length.out = length(tmy$time))

#T2m: 2-m air temperature (degree Celsius)
#RH: relative humidity (%)
#G(h): Global irradiance on the horizontal plane (W/m2)
#Gb(n): Beam/direct irradiance on a plane always normal to sun rays (W/m2)
#Gd(h): Diffuse irradiance on the horizontal plane (W/m2)
#IR(h): Surface infrared (thermal) irradiance on a horizontal plane (W/m2)
#WS10m: 10-m total wind speed (m/s)
#WD10m: 10-m wind direction (0 = N, 90 = E) (degree)
#SP: Surface (air) pressure (Pa)
